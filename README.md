You can upload the dataset to SQL using the link I shared.

*First load the ceratedataset file, then the insertdata file.*

You can solve these questions to practice:

1-Write an SQL query to retrieve the name, phone number, email, and department ID of employees working in the Marketing department.
2-Write an SQL query to retrieve the first name, last name, phone number, email, and department ID of employees in department number 5.
3-Write an SQL query to extract the first three digits of employees' phone numbers.
4-Write an SQL query to concatenate the first and last names with a space in between.
